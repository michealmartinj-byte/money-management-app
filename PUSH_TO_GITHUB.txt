# Push to GitHub - Quick Setup Script

This script will help you push your Money Manager project to GitHub in just a few steps.

## What to do:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter repository name: `money-manager-martingale`
3. Add description: "💰 Money Management App with percentage-based Martingale trading strategy"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL
After creating the repo on GitHub, you'll see a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/money-manager-martingale.git
```

Copy this URL.

### Step 3: Run These Commands
Open PowerShell in the project folder and paste these commands (replace the URL with yours):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Madhusudhan\Documents\money management app"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/money-manager-martingale.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Enter GitHub Credentials
- If asked for credentials, enter your GitHub username and password/token
- If 2FA enabled, use a Personal Access Token (generate at https://github.com/settings/tokens)

## Done! 🎉

Your project will now be on GitHub. Share the link with others!

## If You Already Have an Existing GitHub Repo:

To push to an **existing** repository instead:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EXISTING_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

Or if the remote already exists:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Useful Git Commands:

```powershell
# Check remote URLs
git remote -v

# View local commits not yet pushed
git log origin/main..HEAD

# View git status
git status

# Make a new commit after changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```
